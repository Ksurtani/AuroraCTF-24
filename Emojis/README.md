# Emojis?

A brief solution of how to solve this challenge which was given in ISTE and MIST Aurora CTF.


## Solution

A string of emojis was provided with this question. It was:

    😎😊😜😎😎😊🥳😊😎🥳😎😎🥳😊😊😊😊😜😎😊😎😊😊😎😜😊😇😎😎😇😎😜😊😎😊😊😇🥳😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😇😎😊😎😊😜😊🥳😎😎😊😎😎😎😊😊😊😊😊😎😎😎😇😎😊😊😎😎😎😎😊😎😊😎😎😊😊😇😊😎😎😎😎🥳😊🥳😎😊😊😊😊😎🥳😊😊😎😇😎😎

When you join the discord server for the event, you will notice a bot going by the name `sudo.Aura`. This bot has only one command, which is `/decipher`.

If you use the command in the DMs and give the emoji string as an input, it will decipher it and give the flag instantly.
